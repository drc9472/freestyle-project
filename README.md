## NYC Home Prices vs Inflation Tool
In this application we developed a tool for used to select a NYC neighborhood, average the
neighborhood’s YOY change in prices and compare that to inflation.
We also identify if the area is overvalued, undervalued, or fairly valued based on the average YOY
neighborhood price changes adjusted for inflation.
## Purpose
The purpose of this tool is to be used to assist NYC home buyers in their pursuit of best prices relative to
inflation increases. The developer used basic Python code with a dropdown for user selection and
comparison charts and a valuation notice to assist users in their NYC home search.
